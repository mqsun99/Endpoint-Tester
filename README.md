This endpoint tester helped me learn about what REST is and how to use it, how it relates to CRUD, and using the fetch API more in depth.  
## Steps taken
- Setting Up a Mock REST API Server using npm package json-server (https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server)
- Making Requests to the REST API Server
- Making API Requests with Javascript
